# Building a REST API with Spring Boot

This project is part of my learning journey in Test Driven Development (TDD) and the Red-Green-Refactor approach. It is based on the online courses provided by [spring.io](https://spring.io) under [spring.academy/courses](https://spring.academy/courses) - Building a REST API with Spring Boot.

## Key Concepts and Technologies
- **Restful Endpoints**: The application features a set of RESTful endpoints to perform various operations.
- **Secured Spring Application**: Leveraging Spring Security to ensure the safety of application data.
- **Layered Architecture**: The project follows a layered architectural pattern for better separation of concerns.
- **Spring Web & Spring Data**: Utilizing Spring Web for creating web applications and Spring Data for data access.
- **Technologies and Libraries**: The application implements various technologies and libraries such as Spring-Web, Spring-Test, Spring-Security, H2, JUnit, and AssertJ.
- **HTTP/CRUD Operations & Tests**: Implementing and testing various HTTP/CRUD operations.
- **Git Multi-Branch Practice**: Applying my own git multi-branching practices for version control.

## Running the Application
- Developed and tested in a Windows 10 environment.
- Utilizing Gradle for build automation.
- To execute all application tests, run `./gradlew test` within the project directory.
